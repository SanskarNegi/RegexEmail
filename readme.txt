It is very boring task to find email adress in a long web page or documents. But you can do that by simply copying the text from website or document into clipboard, and then run programm, It could replace the text on the clipboard with just email
addresses it finds, and you can copy that extracted email address from clipboard to any where.

your programm will do the following:
(i) Get the text from clipboard
(ii) Find all email addresses in the text
(iii) Paste them onto the clipboard

We are creating our programm in python, using the re module(Regular Expression), we are also using pyperclip module to copy and paste text into the clipboard.
